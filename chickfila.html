                      “We should be about more than just selling chicken. We should be a part of our customers’ lives and the communities in which we serve.”

                 <p>Why we're closed on Sundays
                     <br/><br/>
Our founder, Truett Cathy, made the decision to close on Sundays in 1946 when he opened his first restaurant in Hapeville, Georgia. Having worked seven days a week in restaurants open 24 hours, Truett saw the importance of closing on Sundays so that he and his employees could set aside one day to rest and worship if they choose - a practice we uphold today.</p>
